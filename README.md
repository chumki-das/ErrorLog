# 🧠 ErrorLog

**ErrorLog** is a tool for test-takers who want to efficiently track, tag, and review their mistakes — no matter the source format.

Whether you're studying for the GMAT, GRE, or another standardized exam, ErrorLog helps you build a clean, searchable, and customized error log — even from screenshots of non-copyable questions.

## ✨ Why ErrorLog?

Most error logs fall apart because of this one issue: **inconsistent sources**.

Some questions can be copied. Others are locked behind PDFs, test platforms, or screenshots. You want to track your mistakes — but formatting, friction, and fatigue get in the way.

**ErrorLog was built to fix that.**  
Snap a screenshot. Upload it. Extract the content. Edit, tag, review. That's it.

## 💡 Inspiration

I'm currently studying for the GMAT and realized I was constantly making the same mistakes — but I had no streamlined way to track them. Some questions were copyable, others were buried inside PDFs or on platforms that blocked copy-paste.

ErrorLog was born out of necessity — to create one clean space for all my mistakes, regardless of source. It's helping me study more efficiently, and I hope it helps others too.
